# Bachelor Thesis – Wildfire Prediction from Satellite Images using Artificial Intelligence

This repository presents my Bachelor Thesis, which focuses on applying Artificial Intelligence to predict wildfires based on satellite imagery. 

## 📘 Abstract
The study investigates how deep learning models can be trained on satellite images of green spaces to identify early indicators of wildfire risk. The developed model demonstrates the potential of AI-driven methods to support environmental monitoring and disaster prevention strategies.

## 🛠️ Methodology
- Dataset of satellite images representing green and fire-prone areas  
- Image preprocessing and augmentation for model optimization  
- Model training using convolutional neural networks (CNNs)  
- Evaluation and accuracy assessment of the trained model  

## 💡 Technologies Used
Python, TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas 

## 🎯 Objective
To explore and demonstrate the role of AI and satellite-based data analysis in predicting wildfires and enhancing early warning systems.
